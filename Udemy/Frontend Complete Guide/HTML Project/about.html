      <h1 class="article-title">Santorini Islands, Greece</h1>
      <article>
        Santorini, is an island in the southern Aegean Sea, about 200 km (120
        mi) southeast from the Greek mainland. It is the largest island of a
        small, circular archipelago, which bears the same name and is the
        remnant of a volcanic caldera. It forms the southernmost member of the
        Cyclades group of islands, with an area of approximately 73 km2 (28 sq
        mi) and a 2011 census population of 15,550. The municipality of
        Santorini includes the inhabited islands of Santorini and Therasia, as
        well as the uninhabited islands of Nea Kameni, Palaia Kameni, Aspronisi
        and Christiana. The total land area is 90.623 km2 (34.990 sq mi).
        Santorini is part of the Thira regional unit. The island was the site of
        one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history: the Minoan
        eruption (sometimes called the Thera eruption), which occurred about
        3,600 years ago at the height of the Minoan civilization. The eruption
        left a large caldera surrounded by volcanic ash deposits hundreds of
        metres deep. It may have led indirectly to the collapse of the Minoan
        civilization on the island of Crete, 110 km (68 mi) to the south,
        through a gigantic tsunami.

        Santorini was named by the Latin Empire in the thirteenth century, and
        is a reference to Saint Irene, from the name of the old cathedral in the
        village of Perissa – the name Santorini is a contraction of the name
        Santa Irini. Before then, it was known as Kallístē (Καλλίστη, "the most
        beautiful one"), Strongýlē (Στρογγύλη, "the circular one"), or Thēra.
        The name Thera was revived in the nineteenth century as the official
        name of the island and its main city, but the colloquial name Santorini
        is still in popular use.
